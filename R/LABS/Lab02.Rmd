This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

# Question 1 Home Depot Data 

## **a)** Read in Home Dept Data (all csv files) and find their dimensions.

https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-depot-product-search-relevance/data

The following sets up an API to access Kaggle data directly from R. 

Run:

> install.packages("devtools)

> devtools::install_github("mkearney/kaggler")

**Note** You may have to install Rtools. If needed, it can be found here:

https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/



```{r}

library(kaggler)
kgl_auth(username = "andrescastellano", key = "2c9485c3957e5c115b8f255ca0e52378")
```

```{r}
kgl_competitions_list(search="depot")

```
Competition Id is 4853

```{r}
c1_datalist <- kgl_competitions_data_list(4853)
c1_datalist
c1_data <- kgl_competitions_data_download(4853,c1_datalist$attributes.csv.zip) 
```


The API is not working. Will try and fix later.

### **Loading all .csv files**

```{r}
attributes <- read.csv('C:/Users/Castellano/Documents/Spring2020/CS636/Home Depot/attributes.csv/attributes.csv') # Attributes

dim(attributes)

prod_desc <- read.csv('C:/Users/Castellano/Documents/Spring2020/CS636/Home Depot/product_descriptions.csv/product_descriptions.csv')

dim(prod_desc)

test <- read.csv('C:/Users/Castellano/Documents/Spring2020/CS636/Home Depot/test.csv/test.csv')

dim(test)

train <- read.csv('c:/Users/Castellano/Documents/Spring2020/CS636/Home Depot/train.csv/train.csv')

dim(train)

```
## **b)** Show the right down corner element of each file in R. 

```{r}
attributes[2044803,3]
prod_desc[124428,2]
test[nrow(test),ncol(test)]
train[nrow(train),ncol(train)]
```
## **c)** Output the odd numbers of columns and even number of rows of train.csv

```{r}
train[c(FALSE,TRUE),c(TRUE,FALSE)]

```

## **d)** Save into R objects and load them using dput, dget, save, load, save.image.

```{r}
fil <- tempfile()
c <- train[c(FALSE,TRUE),c(TRUE,FALSE)]
# dput(c)
```

## **e)** Install teh Readr pakage from CRAN.

## **f)** Any difference in terms of speed and loading the data? Write a simple code to print out the time cost of reading the test.csv. data using read.csv or read_csv.

### **Using *read_csv* **


```{r}
library(readr)
system.time(read_csv('C:/Users/Castellano/Documents/Spring2020/CS636/Home Depot/test.csv/test.csv'))

```

### **Using *read.csv* **

```{r}
system.time(read.csv('C:/Users/Castellano/Documents/Spring2020/CS636/Home Depot/test.csv/test.csv'))
```

# Question 2

## **a)** Create a new vector called "test" containing five numbers of your choice.
```{r}
test <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
```
## **b)** Create a second vector called "students" containing five common names.
```{r}
students <- c('Michelle','Bowie','Juan','Andres','James')
```
## **c)** Determine the class of test and students
```{r}
class(test)
class(students)
```

## **d)** Create a data frame containing two columns students and test as defined above.
```{r}
dat <- data.frame(cbind(students,test))
class(dat)
```
## **e)** Convert "test" to character class, and confrim that you were succesful.

```{r}
test <- as.character(test)
class(test)
```
# Question 3

## **a)** Select just sepal lenght and species columns from the Iris data set and save the result to a new data.frame named iris2.
```{r}
data(iris)
iris2 <- data.frame(iris$Sepal.Length,iris$Species)
colnames(iris2) <- c("Sepal Length", "Species")
head(iris2)

```

## **d)** Calculate the mean of the sepal length column in iris2.

```{r}
avg_sep_length <- mean(iris2$`Sepal Length`)
```


## **c)** Calculate the mean of sepal.length, but only for setosa species

```{r}
# setosas <- subset(iris2, Species == 'setosa')
# mean(setosas$`Sepal Length`)
mean(subset(iris2, Species == 'setosa')$'Sepal Length')
```
 ## **d)** Calculate the number of sepal lengths that are more than one standard deviation below the average sepal length
 
```{r}
std_dev <- sd(iris2$`Sepal Length`)
Low_Bound <- avg_sep_length - std_dev
nrow(iris2[iris2$'Sepal Length' < Low_Bound,])
```
 
# Question 4 Write R commands for the following questions:

## **a)** 1000, 1000, 998, 998, 996, 996, …… , 4, 4, 2, 2

```{r}
rep(seq(from = 1000, to = 2, by = -2), each = 2)
```
## **b)** Generate a sequence of 10 "a" and 5 "b"

```{r}
rep(c('a','b'), c(10,5))
```
## **c)** Print rever the order of **b)**

```{r}
rev(rep(c('a','b'),c(10,5)))
```

# Question 5 

Find the row numbers in the iris data set, where the Petal.Length is larger than 5 and Petal.Width is less than 1.7.  And print out this part of the iris data set.

```{r}
iris[iris$Petal.Length > 5 & iris$Petal.Width < 1.7,]
```

# Question 6

Guess what the following matrix would look like and the results of the following commands and compare with the real results.


**x <- matrix(c(rep(6,3), seq(10,2,-3),x(NA,3,4),6,1,10),4,3)**

```{r}
x <- matrix(c(rep(6,3), seq(10,2,-3),c(NA,3,4), 6,1,10), 4, 3)
```

__print(x[,x[2,] > 4])__

Select from matrix x, all the rows and columns for which the second row of any column is greater than 4. 

```{r}
print(x[,x[2,] > 4])
```

__print(x[,2] < 4)__

Print the elements of x for which the second column is less than 4

```{r}
print(x[,2] < 4)
```
Wrong, this code prints logical whether or not the elements are < 4

<br />


print(x[x[,2] < 4,])

Prints the actual values of x for which the second column is less than 4 

```{r}
print(x[x[,2] < 4,])
```
 Don't actually understand what this did.
 
 __sum(x[x > 6])__
 Sums all the values of elements of x > 6
```{r}
x
sum(x[x > 6])
```
 Don't understand NA.
 
 __sum(x[x > 6],na.rm=T)__
 
This shall remove the NAs from Calc. Which makes me think the reason it didnt work before, is because you cannot add numbers to NAs.

```{r}
sum(x[x > 6],na.rm=T)
```
 
__order(x[,3])__
This should order the elements of x along the third axis in ascending order.

```{r}
order(x[,3])
```
It didn't. It ordered the INDICES of the matrix according to the increasing value of elements. 

__x[order(x[,3]),]__

This should do what I thought the prvious code was going to do.

```{r}
x[order(x[,3]),]

```

It did.

Thanks.
